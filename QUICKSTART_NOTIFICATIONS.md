# Quick Start Guide

## What Changed?

### 🇨🇦 Canadian Survey
The energy survey now uses Canadian provinces instead of US states, with electricity rates in Canadian dollars (CAD/kWh).

### 🔔 Browser Notifications
You can now receive notifications even when the app is closed! Get notified about:
- Friends completing tasks
- Your leaderboard position changing
- Daily reminders (after 6 PM if you haven't logged in)

## How to Use

### Enable Notifications

1. **Log in or Sign up**
   - You'll be asked to allow notifications
   - Click "Allow" in the browser prompt

2. **Or enable later in Settings**
   - Go to Settings page
   - Find "Notifications" section
   - Click "Enable" button
   - Allow in browser prompt

### Test Notifications

1. Go to **Settings > Notifications**
2. Make sure permission is granted
3. Click the **"Test"** button
4. You should see a test notification!

### Customize Notification Types

In Settings > Notifications, you can toggle:
- ✅ Daily Reminders (after 6 PM)
- ✅ Friend Activity (when friends complete tasks)
- ✅ Leaderboard Updates (when your rank changes)
- ✅ Achievement Alerts (when you earn achievements)

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing?

**Check Browser Permission:**
1. Look for 🔔 icon in your browser's address bar
2. Make sure notifications are "Allowed"
3. If blocked, you need to change it in browser settings

**Chrome:**
- Click the 🔔 icon in address bar
- Or go to: Settings > Privacy and security > Site Settings > Notifications

**Firefox:**
- Click the 🔔 icon in address bar
- Or go to: Preferences > Privacy & Security > Permissions > Notifications

**Safari:**
- Safari > Preferences > Websites > Notifications

**Still not working?**
- Check if "Do Not Disturb" mode is on (macOS/Windows)
- Try in a different browser
- Clear cache and try again

### Daily Reminder Not Coming?

Daily reminders only trigger:
- After 6:00 PM
- If you haven't logged in that day
- Once per day maximum
- Only if toggle is ON in Settings

### Friend/Leaderboard Notifications?

These check periodically:
- Leaderboard: Every 5 minutes
- Friends: Every 10 minutes

So there may be a slight delay before you see the notification.

## Privacy

All notification settings are stored locally on your device. The app:
- ✅ Only sends notifications if you grant permission
- ✅ Doesn't track what notifications you see
- ✅ Can be disabled anytime in Settings
- ✅ Doesn't send your data anywhere

## Tips

1. **Test First**: Always use the Test button to verify notifications work
2. **Mobile**: Works best on Android Chrome. iOS Safari has limited support
3. **Desktop**: Full support on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari
4. **Cleanup**: Disabling notifications in Settings removes all tracking data
