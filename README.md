# Energy Saving Teen — Landing (Vite + React + Tailwind)\n\nThis repository contains a scaffold for the Energy Saving Teen landing site implemented with:\n- React + Vite\n- Tailwind CSS (mobile-first)\n- Simple components: Header, Hero, Features, Footer\n\n## Local development\n\n1. Install dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n2. Run the dev server:\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n3. Build:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n4. Preview production build locally:\n```bash\nnpm run preview\n```\n\n## Notes about the implementation\n- Mobile-first Tailwind implementation. Desktop responsiveness is provided via breakpoints.\n- Uses a placeholder app preview image. If you have exported SVG/PNG assets from the Figma file, place them in `public/` or `src/assets/` and update the `Hero` component image path.\n- No backend or auth yet; structure allows adding API routes or integrating with services later.\n\n## Render deployment instructions\n\nTo deploy this static site to Render as a Static Site:\n\n1.
